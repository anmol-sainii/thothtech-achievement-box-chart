# ThothTech Achievement Box Chart

This repository serves as the initial prototype for updating the existing achievement bar chart. It utilizes the [ngx-charts](https://swimlane.github.io/ngx-charts/) library to render a vertical bar chart.

## Purpose

This prototype aims to enhance the current achievement bar chart by providing a more interactive and informative visualization of student achievements. The integration of individual progress overlays will offer a comprehensive view of performance metrics.

## Pending Integrations

Before full integration, the following steps are required:

- **Student Progress Overlay**: Implement an overlay to display student progress on top of the current bar chart as in the current project:
- **Fix Colour Palette**: Fix colour palette to match the current theme
